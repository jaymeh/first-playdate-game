# Shop Game
Player runs a small shop where they can buy and sell items to customers. The player manages inventory and pricing. They can order these things from suppliers to make a profit.

Theres a concept of mining and gathering resources to sell to any customers. This will help them save more but at the cost of time and effort.

## Features
- Buying and selling items
- Managing inventory
- Pricing strategy to maximize profit
- Ordering from suppliers
- Simple customer AI with varying demands
- Mining/gathering resources to sell
- Upgrading shop facilities

## Considerations
This is another popular genre that has been done lots before. I can see various existing examples on the playdate already. The challenge will be to make it feel fresh and engaging within the constraints of the Playdate hardware.

## Skill Level
Beginner - Intermediate: The core mechanics are straightforward, but adding depth through upgrades and variety may require more advanced programming skills.

## Art Style
A cute and colorful pixel art style would work well for this game. The shop environment should be detailed enough to feel lively, with various items, customers, and shop upgrades. Characters should be charming and expressive to enhance the player's connection to the game.

## Artwork
- Shop environment (interior, exterior)
- Item sprites (various products to buy/sell)
- Customer sprites (different types of customers)
- Supplier sprites
- UI elements (inventory, pricing screen, upgrade menus)
