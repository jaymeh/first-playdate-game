# Tamagotchi Pets
You hatch, train and battle pets in an old school digimon/tamogotchi type game. This is a base idea and can be adopted to things like horse racing games and the like.

## Considerations
Game becomes a lot about the pets and amount of pets really makes a big difference to keep the game feeling fresh and engaging. When I have a lot of art to make, this can put a lot of pressure in to keep the designs feeling engaging and fresh. There's also a huge amount of animation needed which makes a challenge.

If I keep the scope low and try not to make too much for this, it can be quite an enjoyable build and experience.

## Skill Level
Medium/High, quite a challenge to fit a lot in and requires a lot of interesting art etc to keep it engaging.

## Art Style
Cutesy small graphics showing off the pet. May need a lot of animations to keep the pets feeling fresh and engaging

## Artwork
- Numerous pets, this list can be very basic at the start 3 - 5 but can slowly expand over time
- Different pet environments
  - Battle Screen
  - Home/Garden screen

## Challenges/Considerations
As more pets are added/built balancing becomes a challenge and as the amount of pets grows so does the complexity and challenges.

## Interest Score
3/5
