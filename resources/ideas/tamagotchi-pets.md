# Tamagotchi Pets
You hatch, train and battle pets in an old school digimon/tamogotchi type game. This is a base idea and can be adopted to things like horse racing games and the like.

## Features
- Hatching pets from eggs
- Feeding and caring for pets
- Training pets to improve stats
- Battling pets against other pets
- Evolving pets into new forms
- Customizing pet appearance

## Considerations
Game becomes a lot about the pets and amount of pets really makes a big difference to keep the game feeling fresh and engaging. When I have a lot of art to make, this can put a lot of pressure in to keep the designs feeling engaging and fresh. There's also a huge amount of animation needed which makes a challenge.

If I keep the scope low and try not to make too much for this, it can be quite an enjoyable build and experience.

The only downside is that this type of game has been done a lot before so making it feel fresh and engaging is a challenge.

## Skill Level
Medium/High, quite a challenge to fit a lot in and requires a lot of interesting art etc to keep it engaging.

## Art Style
Cutesy small graphics showing off the pet. May need a lot of animations to keep the pets feeling fresh and engaging

## Artwork
- Numerous pets, this list can be very basic at the start 3 - 5 but can slowly expand over time
- Different pet environments
  - Battle Screen
  - Home/Garden screen

## Challenges/Considerations
As more pets are added/built balancing becomes a challenge and as the amount of pets grows so does the complexity and challenges.

## Interest Score
3/5
