# Asteroids Style Game
A game I loved playing was Space Miner, which was a take on the classic Asteroids game. The player controls a spaceship that can rotate and thrust around the screen, shooting asteroids and collecting resources. The goal is to mine asteroids for valuable minerals while avoiding collisions and enemy ships.

Once things were mined the player could return to a mothership to sell their resources and upgrade their ship with better weapons, shields, and engines. Then do it all over again.

## Features
- 2D space environment with wrap-around screen
- Player controls a spaceship that can rotate, thrust, and shoot
- Asteroids of varying sizes that break apart when shot
- Resource collection from destroyed asteroids
- Mothership for selling resources and upgrading the ship
- Enemy ships that attack the player
- Simple upgrade system for ship improvements

## Considerations
The core mechanics of movement and shooting are straightforward, but implementing the resource collection, upgrade system, and enemy AI will require more advanced programming skills.

## Skill Level
Intermediate - Advanced: There's a the concept of multiple tiles sitting off the edge of the screen which need to be managed within the Playdate's memory constraints.

## Art Style
A retro pixel art style would work well for this game, reminiscent of classic arcade games. The space environment can be represented with simple star fields and colorful asteroids. The spaceship and enemy ships can have more detail to make them stand out. The UI should be clean and minimal to keep the focus on the gameplay.

## Artwork
- Spaceship sprites (various designs and upgrades)
- Asteroid sprites (various sizes and types)
- Resource sprites (minerals, ores)
- Mothership sprite
- Enemy ship sprites
- Background elements (star fields, planets)
- UI elements (resource counter, upgrade menu)
