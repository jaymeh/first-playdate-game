# Miner Game

## Premise
Simple mining game where the player controls a character that digs through the ground to collect resources while avoiding obstacles.

Resources can be sold for coins and the player can upgrade their equipment to dig faster or carry more resources.

## Considerations
Simple 2D graphics with a set level layout to keep it simple. Focus on core mechanics of digging, collecting resources, and upgrading equipment.

## Skill Level
Beginner to intermediate. Basic knowledge of game development and programming concepts is helpful.

## Art Style
Need to consider how all of this works with the Playdate's black and white display and low resolution. Simple, pixel art style would work well. We don't want background details to distract from the main player or resources.

Need to consider how to get this contrast, maybe look at a few existing Playdate games for inspiration.

## Artwork
Below is a list of artwork needed for the game:
- Player character sprites (idle, digging, walking)
- Ground tiles (various types of soil, rocks)
- Resource sprites (gold, gems, coal)
- Obstacle sprites (rocks, traps)
- Upgrade icons (pickaxe, backpack, etc.)
- Background elements (cave walls, tunnels)
