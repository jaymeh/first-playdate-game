# Turn Based Fighter
I remember back in the days, playing the DBZ Game on the Cartoon Network website. This worked by having playr pick turns against the AI for which moves to use. These were picking a move that allowed you to move to a location, power yourself up and attack another player.

It was quite a novel concept at the time but could work quite nicely on the playdate and tie into using the crank etc to charge up energy and win against the enemy.

Theres a lot of room for iteration, expansion and movesets. Might be nice to include gatcha mechcanics for improved moves and player levels/hearts.

## Considerations
Has plenty of room to grow, you can introduce new moves and character sets and the ability to level up and unlock things as you progress. There's space for some kind of story aspect to it and it ensures that we just draw the full screen with no need for tiling etc. Might work well given the constraints of the device.

## Skill Level
Intermediate - Advanced: Though this is based on how many and what features can be included.

## Art Style
I have a vision of this being quite realistic for characters with quite detailed backgrounds. UI is also a big one for this game as this will always be visible.

## Artwork
- Full screen backgrounds
- Players
- Move UI Icons
- Health Bars, levels ups etc
- Menu Screen
- Upgrades screen

## Timescale
I think a couple of months for this full time would probably get us most of the way.

## Interest Score
4/5
