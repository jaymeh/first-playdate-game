# Turn Based Fighter
The player takes turns against the AI picking different moves to use against them. These can unleash attacks with various degrees of power and speed, which target specific zones the opponent may be located. Players can also choose to defend or heal themselves during their turn. 

## Features
- Charge up attacks with the crank
- Multiple characters to choose from
- Leveling up of characters
- Unlocking new moves
- Simple AI for enemy players

## Considerations
Has plenty of room to grow, you can introduce new moves and character sets and the ability to level up and unlock things as you progress. There's space for some kind of story aspect to it and it ensures that we just draw the full screen with no need for tiling etc. Might work well given the constraints of the device.

## Skill Level
Intermediate - Advanced: Though this is based on how many and what features can be included.

## Art Style
I have a vision of this being quite realistic for characters with quite detailed backgrounds. UI is also a big one for this game as this will always be visible.

## Artwork
- Full screen backgrounds
- Players
- Move UI Icons
- Health Bars, levels ups etc
- Menu Screen
- Upgrades screen

## Timescale
I think a couple of months for this full time would probably get us most of the way.

## Interest Score
4/5
