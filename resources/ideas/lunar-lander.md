# Lunar Lander
Simple take on the Lunar Lander style game. I can remember things like Fathom II from back in the Sky Games days that follows a similar style and gameplay loop.

## Considerations
Game is quite simple in concept but can be made more complex with various levels, obstacles and challenges. The art style can be quite minimal to keep things simple and focused on the gameplay.

## Features
- Simple lunar lander controls (thrust, rotate)
- Fuel management
- Landing zones with varying difficulty
- Multiple levels with increasing challenge
- Obstacles (rocks, craters)
- Score based on landing accuracy and fuel efficiency

## Skill Level
Beginner - Intermediate: The core mechanics are straightforward, but adding levels and obstacles may require more advanced programming skills.

## Art Style
A minimalist pixel art style would work well for this game. The lunar surface can be represented with simple shapes and textures, while the lander itself can have more detail to make it stand out. The background can be a starry sky to enhance the space theme.

## Artwork
- Lunar surface (various terrain types)
- Lander sprites (different designs or upgrades)
- Obstacles (rocks, craters)
- Background elements (stars, planets)
- UI elements (fuel gauge, altitude indicator)
- Level selection screen

## Interest Score
2/5
