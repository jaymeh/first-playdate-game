# Farming Game
The player runs a small farm where they can plant, grow, and harvest crops. They can also raise animals and sell their produce at a market to earn money.

The game can include seasons, weather effects, and various types of crops and animals to keep the gameplay engaging.

## Features
- Planting and harvesting crops
- Raising animals (cows, chickens, etc.)
- Selling produce at a market
- Upgrading farm equipment and buildings
- Seasonal changes affecting crop growth

## Considerations
This is a relaxing and casual game that can be played in short sessions. The art style should be charming and inviting, with a focus on the farm environment and characters. The game mechanics should be simple to understand but offer depth through upgrades and variety in crops and animals.

This game type has been done before quite frequently and I can spot several existing Playdate games that do similar things. The challenge will be to make it feel fresh and engaging within the constraints of the Playdate hardware.

## Skill Level
Beginner - Intermediate: The core mechanics are straightforward, but adding depth through upgrades and variety may require more advanced programming skills.

## Art Style
A cute and colorful pixel art style would work well for this game. The farm environment should be detailed enough to feel lively, with various crops, animals, and buildings. Characters should be charming and expressive to enhance the player's connection to the game.

## Artwork
- Farm environment (fields, barns, market)
- Crop sprites (various types of plants)
- Animal sprites (cows, chickens, etc.)
- Character sprites (farmer, market customers)
- UI elements (inventory, market screen, upgrade menus)
- Seasonal variations (spring, summer, fall, winter)
